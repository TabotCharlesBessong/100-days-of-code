    "Also don't worry if you find the matplotlib syntax frustrating, we actually won't be using it that often throughout the course, we will switch to using seaborn and pandas built-in visualization capabilities. But, those are built-off of matplotlib, which is why it is still important to get exposure to it!\n",
