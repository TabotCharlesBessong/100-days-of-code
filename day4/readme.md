# Day 4 talks about logical operator 
## If and else state or elif can be effective as we can run different scenarios , 
## However it is not effective so we include the boolean operator  like the (or) and (and) operator  which will enable us to run multiple process at the same time 

### so we can or some statement or do an and to it 

## with or , at least one need to be true

### True or True  = True
### True or False  = True
### False or True  = True
### False or False  = False

## with and , both process need to be true

### True or True  = True
### True or False  = False
### False or True  = False
### False or False  = False

## There are many other logical operators , however these 2 are the most common
